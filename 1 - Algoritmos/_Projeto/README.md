# Trip of the Sockets

This exercise was given as final work in the subject of algorithms in the first semester of the Computer Science course at Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Paraná.

Description of the exercise:

Finally, the University team managed to qualify for the SBC Programming Marathon National Final. The three team members and the coach are eager to represent the University well, and in addition to training a lot, they are preparing with every detail their trip to São Paulo, where the National Final will be held. They plan to take all of their various electronic equipment on the trip: cell phone, tablet, notebook, wifi hotspot, cameras, etc., and they know they will need multiple power outlets to connect all this equipment. They have been informed that the four of them will be staying in the same hotel room, but have been advised that in each room there is only one power outlet available. With caution, the three team members and the coach each purchased a power strip, thus enabling them to plug several devices into the single outlet in the hotel room; they can also link one ruler to another to further increase the number of available outlets. However, since rulers have many outlets, they asked you to write a program that, given the number of outlets on each ruler, determines the maximum number of appliances that can be connected to power at any one time. The input consists of a file (input.txt) with a line with four integers indicating the number of shots of each of the four rulers (minimum 2 (two) and maximum 6 (six) taken per ruler). Your program should produce a single line containing a single integer, indicating the maximum number of devices that can be connected to power at any one time.

Examples:

Input 1: 2 4 3 2 ---- Output: 8

Entry 2: 6 6 6 6 ---- Exit: 21

Input 3: 2 2 2 2 ---- Output: 5
